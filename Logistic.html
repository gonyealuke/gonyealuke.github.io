										<h2>Problem</h2>
									</header>
									<p>One of our key customerâ€™s became frustrated with the performance of the ICONICS platform on their large projects. They worked closely with the support team but did not feel like ICONICS was listening to their feedback. This led to the customer getting their upper management involved to express their dissatisfaction.</p>

												<h3>Proactively Engaging The Customer</h3>
											</header>
											<p>When I heard the frustrations of the customer during a monthly meeting, I took initiative and started contacting ICONICS upper management and engineering team directly to express the needs of the customer. This process included working closely with the customer to ensure I understood their applications and its demands on the ICONICS platform and then translating those demands to the engineering team at ICONICS.</p>

												<h3>Performance Testing</h3>
											</header>
											<p>One of the biggest complaints from the customer was that they felt that there was no metrics validating platform performance at a project of their size. Instead of shrugging off their complaints, I took responsibility and conducted my own tests. Once the testing was completed, I shared the results with the customer and ICONICS engineering so we could establish the best path forward. This led to the customer implementing best-practice strategies when configuring their projects and ICONICS engineering improving the performance of the software.</p>

												<h3>Outcome</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The customer was impressed with the time that ICONICS invested into testing their application and finding potential improvement areas. This improved rapport between the customer and ICONICS led to the customer continuing to use the ICONICS software in new project design as well as updating old projects to newer versions of the ICONICS software. To this day, I remain the first point of contact for the customer if they have any issues or questions about the ICONICS platform.</p>
