										<h2>What is Unity Fitness?</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Unity Fitness is a personal training service that my girlfriend and I started in May 2020. We offer in-home personal training and coaching to clients of all ages and experience levels in the Greater Springfield Area. In addition to training clients, we handle all marketing and financial functions that come with running a business.</p>

												<h3>Why We Started?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Your health is arguably the most important aspect of your life. Your work, your relationships, or anything else you work so hard to achieve is meaningless if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it. We started Unity Fitness to make this philosophy a reality for our clients. Improving our own health changed our lives and we know it can do the same for others.</br>Coupled with the urge to help people live healthier, happier lives, I have a strong interest in starting and building my own business. Running a business requires the right blend of persistence, intelligence and risk-taking. I think I hold all these traits and wanted to put them to the test by starting Unity Fitness.</p>

												<h3>Challenges So Far</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Running a business of any size requires the entrepreneur to wear several hats. My background in engineering certainly helped with configurating various business tools but other aspects left me reaching for several books and other sources. Here are some of the things I have had to learn so far:</br>• Designing the Unity Fitness Website</br>• Small Business Marketing - CRM, advertising</br>• Steps to start a business in MA</br>• Taking a risk and exposing your ideas to the public</p>

												<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
											</header>
											<p>A mission statement is your business’s guiding light. A well-defined mission statement gives your business the principles to base every decision. Here is the mission statement for Unity Fitness:</br>Unity Fitness’s goal is to empower people to take control of their own health and wellness. We want to help all clients build the foundations of an active, sustainable lifestyle. We, at Unity Fitness, want to guide you on your journey to be a stronger, healthier You.</p>
