										<h2>Project Overview</h2>

									<p>For the proof-of-concept, I was involved from the initial software demonstration all the way through creating a live system that was connected to the customer’s controllers. I was the lead engineer on the project, and I was responsible for both configurating the technology and the communicating the status of the project with key customer stakeholders.</p>

												<h3>Working With All Levels Of The Organization</h3>
											</header>
											<p>At each phase of the project, I had to meet and present the ICONICS solution to the various customer stakeholders. The stakeholders ranged from members of the IT department to ensure the ICONICS solution met the technology needs of the project to C-suite executives deciding if the software should be purchased as an operational or capital expense. The presentations had several iterations of getting feedback from the customer, adjusting the ICONICS project, and presenting the changes to solidify that ICONICS was the right platform for the job.</p>

												<h3>Technology Challenges</h3>
											</header>
											<p>As part of the POC, the customer wanted to monitor remote equipment via the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). To establish communication with the remote devices and the ICONICS software I had to work closely with the customer IT team to create proper network connections. This required a thorough understanding of both SNMP and the customer devices. Leveraging online resources and contacting the customer’s equipment vendors, we received the controller information and proved ICONICS was a technological fit for the application.</p>

												<h3>Building The Realtionship</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The customer awarded ICONICS the project and have been working closely with ICONICS to get the software up and running. I was involved with the early stages of project management and design before turning the project over to our services team to make sure that the customer requirements were fully understood and defined.</p>
