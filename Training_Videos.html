										<h2>Overview</h2>
									</header>
									<p>A large part of my role as a Solution Sales Engineer is to not only understand the ICONICS technology but also be able to explain the software and its features to a non-technical audience. The ability to articulate these technical concepts is one of my professional strengths. This communication has taken several forms over my time at ICONICS ranging from blog posts, training videos, webcasts, and other events.</p>

												<h3>Training Video Library</h3>
											</header>
											<p>To date, I have scripted, recorded, and produced over 6 hours of video training content. The training videos are hosted on the ICONICS website and are available to the public. Creating the videos not only required a strong understanding of the ICONICS technology but also the ability to make the lessons easy to follow for the end-users. The subjects of the training videos span a wide range of the ICONICS products and demanded me to become an ICONICS product expert.</p>

												<h3>ICONICS Blog</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My favorite part of being a Sales Engineer is having the opportunity is to simply to talk and learn more about otherâ€™s challenges and experiences. Although this communication is mostly verbal, I also think there is value in written explanations. This led me to test my hand at writing technical blogs for the ICONICS website.</p>

												<h3>Webcasts, virtual events, and more</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Between webcasts for new versions of our software and other events that ICONICS has hosted in the last several years, I have presented the ICONICS software to thousands of individuals. These presentations range from traditional PowerPoint presentations to in-depth technical demos of our software. The presentations require a lot of preparation and time commitment but, I am always happy to share my ideas with a large audience.</p>
